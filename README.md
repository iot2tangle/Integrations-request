# I2T Integration Requests

If you have code to integrate an IoT device with IOTA Streams and you think it could be of value, [**submit an issue here**](https://github.com/iot2tangle/integrations/issues) linking to the code and explaining how to test it. 

Keep in mind that your work will have to meet two conditions:

- Easy step by step guide Readme 
- Use the I2T Json Standard

## Our Json Standard

Our Rust Gateway will listen and publish to the Tangle via Streams any IoT device data as long as it uses 
the I2T Json Standard. 

```
